# News Site

Build a news site that is responsive. Use CSS Grid or/and Flexbox. The responsive should have the following views; Desktop 4 columns, tablet 2 columns, mobile 1 column.

I made online magazine for Mercedes Formula 1 team. I have always been fascinated by Formula 1 and fast cars and after watching the Formula 1 series on Netflix I got even more hooked. So I thought why not make a nice looking online news site. 

## The problem

How I built my site
I decided to use CSS Grids for the layout. The page is divided in to 3 sections. Body-main-grid, div-grid-continer, div-main-article. And in my main grid I have wrapper-card for the small news.

What I learned:
* This is my first time building a responsive page so I learned about CSS Grids and media queries. 
* I learned that CSS Grids is really responsive and you can do a lot within the grids. It‚Äôs really flexible.
* Deep dived into HTML, CSS and CSS Grids, there is SO much that I‚Äôve learned this last week, and there is so much more TO learn. Yay üéâ
When I hit a dead end or a problem
When a problem arose, I either googled, used dev-tools or asked my classmates. My plan was to first try to solve the problem myself and when that didn‚Äôt work I asked my classmates or the teachers. Matilda helped me with a CSS grid problem. 

My own reflection
I wish I had more time so I could do more trial and errors. If I do this, what will happened then? My plan now is to make a huge ‚Äútest-document‚Äù with colourful boxes so I can test differens techniques. üë©‚Äçüíª
