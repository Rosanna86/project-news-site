# News Site

Build a news site that is responsive. Use CSS Grid or/and Flexbox. The responsive should have the following views; Desktop 4 columns, tablet 2 columns, mobile 1 column.

I made online magazine for Mercedes Formula 1 team. I have always been fascinated by Formula 1 and fast cars and after watching the Formula 1 series on Netflix I got even more hooked. So I thought why not make a nice looking online news site. 

## The problem

When a problem arose, I either googled, used dev-tools or asked my classmates. My plan was to first try to solve the problem myself and when that didn’t work I asked my classmates or the teachers. Matilda helped me with a CSS grid problem. 

I wish I had more time so I could do more trial and errors. If I do this, what will happened then? My plan now is to make a huge “test-document” with colourful boxes so I can test different techniques.
